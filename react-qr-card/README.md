## Overview
-The goal of the challenge is to create a card layout that includes a QR code. 
The card layout should be visually appealing and well-structured. 
It's important to note that the card layout does not shift, which makes it an ideal exercise for beginners who are still learning about building responsive designs.

## My process

- I started by using a mobile-first approach for designing the web page. This means that I focused on creating the layout and content specifically for smaller screens like mobile phones. By starting with mobile, I ensured that the page would be functional and user-friendly on smaller devices.

- To enhance the typography of the page, I used Google Fonts. Google Fonts provides a wide range of fonts that can be easily integrated into a web project. I selected a suitable font from the Google Fonts library and included it in my project. This helped improve the overall appearance and readability of the text on the page.

- By adopting a mobile-first approach and utilizing Google Fonts, I was able to create a well-designed and visually appealing web page that is optimized for mobile devices and provides an excellent user experience.
